So what is the Adapt Framework?

You can read the full detail on the [community site](http://community.adaptlearning.org) (start with the Vision).

The Framework is a JavaScript client-side application that delivers Responsive e-learning.

E-Learning content is defined in JSON files which are included into a package along with various components or plugins.  The Adapt Framework takes these JSON files, applies them to the included components and builds Responsive HTML5 pages using them.
