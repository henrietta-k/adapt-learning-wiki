Adapt v5 aims to make it easier to read and write the Adapt framework and plugins by introducing [BEM](http://getbem.com/), a new naming convention, and [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/), a modular approach to front end code. It transitions away from pixels towards em’s which increases support for differing browser zoom and font size settings which improves Adapt’s [accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C14.html). The LESS has been modernised to remove duplicity and redundancy removed.
