## What has changed?
Adapt v5 aims to make it easier to read and write the Adapt framework and plugins by introducing [BEM](http://getbem.com/), a new naming convention, and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), a modular approach to front end code. It transitions away from pixels towards rems, which increases support for cross-browser zoom and [font size](https://medium.com/@vamptvo/pixels-vs-ems-users-do-change-font-size-5cfb20831773) settings and improves Adaptâ€™s [accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C14.html). The LESS has been modernised to simplify and remove redundancy, reducing theme interference and the need for multiple overrides.
