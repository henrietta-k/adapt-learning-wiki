#### What is a component

In Adapt we have a concept of components. These components are the main interactive elements found on a page. (Multiple Choice Question, Media, Text and Narrative are all types of components). These components can be split into two categories.

#### Presentational components

A presentational component should be used to display content with little interactivity. A few components that full under this category are: Graphic, Media, Hot Graphic and Narrative.

#### Question components

A question component should be used to test a user or ask a question. Each question component should set the following on it's model:

- ``_isPassed`` (boolean)
- ``_isComplete`` (boolean)
- ``_isReady`` (boolean)
