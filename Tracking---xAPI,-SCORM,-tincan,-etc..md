We need to start using xAPI for tracking our learning in Adapt (because it's the future!).

Some work has been done already (see [ABU-1116](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/browse/ABU-1116))

## Discussion Topics

* review current progress and plan of attack
* Maintain existing spoor plugin for backwards compatibility?
* Port event capture code from spoor to core framework?
* Review events fired by components/extensions/framework - 
  * Are we triggering what we need to? 
  * Are events consistent?
* xAPI extension? (new Scorm one too?)
* Additional tracking types - in addition to SCORM/xAPI?
