## Adapt Learning Authoring Tool
As well as the Adapt Learning Framework we are working on a web based authoring tool.  The [Developer documentation](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki) can be found on its wiki

## The Adapt Learning Project 
For wider discussions about the Open Source project, and additional information about our vision and strategy, you should visit the [Adapt Learning Community Site](https://community.adaptlearning.org/)

We also publish some documentation here on github.  Important documents will be linked to from this wiki, the Authoring Tool wiki and the community site, however you may find some useful stuff by exploring the repository.
