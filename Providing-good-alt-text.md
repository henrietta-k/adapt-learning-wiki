## Why do we use alt text
+ Alternative text, the text equivalent for an image. It is read by screen readers allowing the content of the image to be accessible to those with visual or certain cognitive disabilities. Leave the alt text empty (`"alt": ""`) if the image does not contribute significant course content.  
+ If the alt text is left empty, the image will *not* be included in the tab order.

## Tips for writing good alt text
+ **Be specific and succinct**. Describe what you see. A few words will usually be enough, but charts and diagrams will likely require more thought. Bear in mind that screen readers may cut off alt text at around 125 characters.
+ ***Don’t* be redundant**. If an image doesn't add value and is just there for design purposes, or the context is already covered in the supporting text, leave the alt text empty.
+ ***Don’t* use phrases “image of…” or “graphic of…”** etc. It's already assumed your alt text is referring to an image, so there's no need to specify it.
