Chuck's questions: 
- Does an LMS record as a single course regardless of language chosen?
- How does an LMS respond if the components in each language are no equal in arrangement?  

Introduction  
With Adapt you can localise your content and engage learners in ways that speak from their native culture. Localisation may involve modifying  
- content language
- content data formats used with dates, currency, and units of measure  
- content examples, regulations and legal requirements  
- visual elements such as graphics, design and layout  

Fundamental to localisation is language, so much of the following instruction focuses on providing content in multiple languages.

Adapt's support for multiple languages:  
- language picker: Component that presents a list of available languages and allows the learner to choose which she would prefer to work in. Component can be configured to appear before entering the course content and/or while the course is in progress. 
- import/export: Commands that can be executed with Grunt. Export commands copy translatable fields into several CSV files to be used in preparing a translation. Import commands load translated content from CSV files matching the export format. 

Language Picker  
- What it does
- What it assumes
    - localized content (Adapt does not automatically translate)
    - use of language folder in the course root
    - LMS (see questions above)
