We use [JIRA](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/) to manage the day-to-day work on the Adapt framework. This page aims to give you a quick overview of the features we use.

The Adapt JIRA is open for anyone to view, although an authorised account is needed to perform more administrative tasks. As an anonymous user, you can:
- View all issues
- Report issues
- Comment on issues
- View agile boards (current/upcoming sprints, issue backlog, release planning etc.)

## Issues

**For more information on reporting new issues, [see our guide](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Bugs-and-features).**

One of the main functions of our JIRA is to act as the centralised bug database for the framework stream of the project.

You can view [all framework/core bundle issues](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/browse/ABU-1041?jql=project%20%3D%20ABU) as a long list, but you'll probably find it more useful to apply filters to narrow down your search. JIRA's powerful query engine allows you to do this easily, either by creating simple filters using the UI, or by supplying a [JIRA Query Language string](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracloud/advanced-searching-735937166.html).

We've already set up [a few filters](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/secure/ManageFilters.jspa#filterView=popular) to get you started; here are some examples:
- [Developer issues](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=11401)
- [Front-end issues](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=11402)
- [Content issues](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=11406)
- [Documentation issues](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=11405)
- [Feature requests sorted by number of votes](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/issues/?filter=10801)

## Agile

In addition to the bug database, we use [JIRA agile](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=7) for day-to-day project management:

[**Issue backlog**](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=7&projectKey=ABU&view=planning.nodetail): lists all framework issues, ordered by sprint. The backlog is a good place to get a handle on what work is planned for the near future, but less so for just browsing issues (see the section above instead).

[**Active sprints**](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=7&projectKey=ABU): what's currently being worked on and its current progress. Issues here are separated into swimlanes: the left column lists the issues yet to be started, the centre column lists all of the issues which are currently in-progress, and the left column shows all fixed issues.

[**Versions**](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/projects/ABU?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page): shows any planned releases in the framework's roadmap, including release dates and associated issues. This is the place to go to get an overview of the progress of a release.
