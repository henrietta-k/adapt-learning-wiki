## Working with Adapt

We've tried to make installing and running Adapt as painless as possible by providing the [command line tool](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Adapt-Command-Line-Interface), which automates a lot of the more tedious tasks.

### Installing

Before working on Adapt, you'll need to [do a few things](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Setting-up-your-development-environment) to make sure you've got all of the required tools and libraries.

Adapt requires few pre-requisites prior so if you haven't already, get up-and-running with Adapt by following the [install guide](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Manual-installation-of-the-Adapt-framework).
