We use JIRA to manage all bugs and feature requests for the Adapt framework. If you're new to JIRA, please have a look at our [guide to using the bug tracker](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Using-the-bug-tracker) for some preliminary reading.

## Reporting bugs

<img src="https://github.com/taylortom/notes/blob/master/assets/bug-feature.jpg" align="right">
If you think you’ve found a bug, there are a few things to consider before logging a new issue:

**Can you replicate it?** If the answer to this is no, please think carefully before logging an issue. Although we take bugs seriously, our development time is limited and we can’t afford to spend it failing to replicate bugs.

**Has the issue been reported before?** We have already built up a sizeable back-log of issues, so the issue may have been reported by someone already. Please do therefore [search the list of issues](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/issues/) first. If it has already been reported, any extra information you have garnered from your own tests could be invaluable in fixing it, so please add any such info to the existing ticket, should you find one.

**Is it covered?** By this we mean: is your set-up listed in the [v2.0.0 standards definitions document](https://community.adaptlearning.org/pluginfile.php/24/mod_forum/attachment/3397/Adapt_Framework_v2.0.0_standards_definitions_draft.pdf)? In an ideal world, we’d commit to supporting Adapt on all browsers and operating systems. Unfortunately this isn’t feasible with the resources we have, so we have to prioritise those named in the standards definition.

### What to report
If your bug passes the above tests, the next step is to create an issue.

Try to give your issue a succinct name. Something short, but which still give the reader a good summary of the problem without needing to open the issue.

The main body of the issue needs to contain as much detail as possible about the bug you can provide. This should focus on the following:

A **description** of the bug, **steps** on how to replicate it and your **set up** (i.e. browser and operating system - [aboutmybrowser](http://aboutmybrowser.com) can be useful here). Feel free to include any other information which you think may be useful, screenshots in particular can often give more useful information than words alone!

Make a note of any JavaScript errors you see. You may need to press F12 to reveal your browser's developer tools. If you are testing using a tablet or smartphone you will need to connect it to your PC or Mac in order to get access to the developer tools.

Additionally, if you have been making configuration changes to the test package, please describe what configuration changes are necessary in order to replicate the bug. Please include the snapshots of the relevant .json or .less where necessary (or entire .json/.less files, if that makes more sense).

### Reporting an issue
We use [JIRA](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/) to log and manage all issues. To log a new issue, click the 'Create' button at the top of the page (or press the 'c' key) - or use [this direct link](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa). See below for some advice on what fields to fill out:

* In the **Project** field, select _Adapt Framework_.

* In the **Issue type** field, select _Bug_.

* In the **Summary** field, enter a succinct but informative summary (see the above section _What to report_). If your issue relates to a specific plugin, please prefix the summary with the name of that plugin, for example: "contrib-mcq: feedback not shown".

* In the **Priority** field, choose an appropriate priority level. If you are not sure, please use _Normal_.

* In the **Component/s** field, select _Framework_.

* In both the **Affects Version/s** and **Fix Version/s** fields, select the version that exhibits your issue (in most cases, this will be the latest version, but check the `bower.json` file in the plugin's root folder to be sure). 
<br>*If you can't find the plugin's version, leave this blank, but please be aware that we only test against the latest version when trying to replicate.*

* In the **Environment** field, please enter details about your browser and operating system - for example "IE9 on Windows 7" or "Safari on iPad Mini, iOS 8.3" (or you can add a URL generated by [aboutmybrowser](https://aboutmybrowser.com/))

* In the **Description** field, please enter a description of the issue along with steps to recreate it (see [What to report](#what-to-report)) for more instruction on doing this.

You can ignore the remaining fields.

### Fixing bugs
Do you know how to fix the issue? If so, awesome :thumbsup:! Please cruise over to our [guide to contributing code](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Contributing-code) for instructions on how to get your fix merged.

## Requesting new features

If there's a feature you'd like to see in Adapt, we'd love to hear from you!

We manage feature requests in the same way as issues, so much of [the above](#reporting-an-issue) applies. **The most important thing to remember** when requesting a new feature, is to add `feature-request` to the **Labels** field (you might also want to give a more appropriate **Issue type** than *Bug*!).

Try to give as much detail about your request as you can in the description, as this will give us the best idea of what you want. It would also be beneficial to leave you GitHub username, so we can get in touch with you if we implement your feature.

*A few of the fields mentioned above won't be applicable to feature requests, so feel free to leave those blank.*

### Implementing new features

If you're confident working with the framework on a larger scale, why not grab a [feature-request](https://adaptlearning.atlassian.net/browse/ABU-698?filter=10801) issue and give that a go?
