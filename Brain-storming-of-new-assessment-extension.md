This document is intended to document the discussions around a replacement for adapt-contrib-assessment as discussed at the Adapt Hack.

Requirements:
- **Course-wide** 

Assessment should apply course-wide, as opposed to on an article.  This would allow dispersing questions over several pages.  Technically this is a better match for the Adapt Authoring tool as well.

- **Question banking**

It should be possible to assign any number of question components to associated banks of questions.  These could then be selected something like two questions from Bank A, one from Bank B, and so on.

- **Randomisation**

In conjunction with banking, it should be possible to randomise the appearance and ordering of questions.

- **Retry options**

Properties should allow configuration of the number of retry attempts a user may have.
