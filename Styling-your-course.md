Themes
------
Adapt supports user-defined themes, a special kind of plugin that lets you style your course in a variety of ways. Themes are written in [LESS](http://lesscss.org/), all CSS syntax is supported plus variables and nested rules.

A basic theme, [adapt-contrib-vanilla](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-vanilla) is included in the framework. 

Simple customisation is possible by changing the built-in variable in ```less/variables.less```
