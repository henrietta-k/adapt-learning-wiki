## General tips

This section gives some pointers for getting involved in general Adapt business, be it by contributing to discussions, testing new releases, or just checking project activity.

### Welcome to the community
If you're planning on getting involved with the Adapt project, you'll want to familiarise yourself with the community site: the hub of all things Adapt. The community site, if nothing else, collates all the different areas of the Adapt project, from bug tracking, to documentation, to releases, to social media.

There's also the community forum, which is perused daily by a number of the core Adapt team, as well as other developers and users. If you have an Adapt-related question that can't be answered elsewhere (and hasn't been answered in the forum already), this is the place to go. Please contribute to discussion wherever you can; the Adapt project thrives on the feedback given by developers and users outside of the Adapt 'bubble'. There are always improvements to be made, and new features to be developed; even if you don't have the required skills to implement them yourself, please float your ideas on the forum as there may be someone that can (or has already!).

### Bug spotting
As the Adapt project has to rely on voluntary time, regular, thorough testing cycles are a rarity. Please log any issues you find while working with Adapt on the relevant GitHub repository. If the issue has already been logged, please add any extra information you have, including your current browser/device operating system version and any other configuration set-up you can provide (or even simply an 'I can also replicate this issue'), as this will all be useful to the developer that comes to fix it.
