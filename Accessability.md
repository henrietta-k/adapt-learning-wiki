## Landmarks in Adapt

### ARIA Landmark Roles

Landmarks are attributes you can add to elements in your page to define areas like the main content or a navigation region.

We can define parts of a page using 'roles'. This allows screen reader users the ability to easily jump from one section to another and know where they are going.

Roles provide semantic information therefore these attributes should not be placed on elements that already have semantic meaning. They should only be placed on `<div>` and `<span>` elements. 
 

**alert** - A message with important, and usually time-sensitive, information.

**alertdialog** - A type of dialog that contains an alert message, where initial focus goes to an element within the dialog as with 'notify' pop-ups. 

**button** - An input that allows for user-triggered actions when clicked or pressed.

**checkbox** - A checkable input.

**complementary** - A supporting section of the document, designed to be complementary to the main content yet treated as a navigational landmark such as 'drawer'.

**dialog** - An application window that is designed to interrupt the current processing of an application in order to prompt the user to enter information or require a response such as 'tutor' extension.

**document** - Information that is declared as document content, as opposed to a web application. Used for media component transcript.

**heading** - A heading for a section of the page.

**link** - An interactive reference to an internal or external resource that, when activated, causes the user agent to navigate to that resource.
