### Landmarks in Adapt

Landmarks are attributes you can add to elements in your page to define areas like the main content or a navigation region.

We can define parts of your page using roles. This allows screen reader users the ability to easily jump from one section to another and know where they are going.

All extensions and components should be defined by a role.
