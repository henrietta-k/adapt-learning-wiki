# Landmarks in Adapt

### Landmark Roles

Landmarks are attributes you can add to elements in your page to define areas like the main content or a navigation region.

We can define parts of a page using roles. This allows screen reader users the ability to easily jump from one section to another and know where they are going.
 

**alert** - A message with important, and usually time-sensitive, information.

**alertdialog** - A type of dialog that contains an alert message, where initial focus goes to an element within the dialog. 

**button** - An input that allows for user-triggered actions when clicked or pressed.

**checkbox** - A checkable input.

**dialog** - An application window that is designed to interrupt the current processing of an application in order to prompt the user to enter information or require a response such as tutor extension.

**heading** - A heading for a section of the page.

**main** - The main content of the page. There should only be one 'main' landmark per page.

**menu** - A type of widget that offers a list of choices to the user.

**menuitem** - An option in a set of choices contained by a menu or menubar.

**navigation** - Top bar collection of page navigation links. Standard consists of 'back button' 'progress bar' and 'drawer'.

**progressbar** - An element that displays the progress status for tasks that take a long time.

**radio** - A checkable input in a group of radio roles, only one of which can be checked at a time.

**search** - A search tool. Usually found in drawer.

**slider** - A user input where the user selects a value from within a given range.
