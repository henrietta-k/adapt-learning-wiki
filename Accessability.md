# Landmarks in Adapt

### Landmark Roles

Landmarks are attributes you can add to elements in your page to define areas like the main content or a navigation region.

We can define parts of your page using roles. This allows screen reader users the ability to easily jump from one section to another and know where they are going.
 

**navigation** - Top bar collection of page navigation links. Standard consists of 'back button' 'progress bar' and 'drawer'.

**main** - The main content of the page. There should only be one 'main' landmark per page.

**dialog** - Feedback, often in pop-up form such as tutor extension.

**search** - A search tool. Usually found in drawer.

**button** - An input that allows for user-triggered actions when clicked or pressed.

**checkbox** - A checkable input.

**heading** - A heading for a section of the page.

**menu** - A type of widget that offers a list of choices to the user.

**menuitem** - An option in a set of choices contained by a menu or menubar.
